### Project Overview
The data set which will be investigated here is “Prosper Loans” data. Prosper Loan is an American peer-to-peer lending company that offers personal loans at low rates. Each loan is typically funded by multiple people over the United States. In this way, Prosper is a marketplace connecting those who need a loan to those who have extra money to lend.
 
I'm using R and its graphic package `ggplot` to perform exploratory data analysis on this financial dataset. The primary purpose is to explore relationships from single variable to multiple variables considering its distributions, outliers, and variable characteristics.

### Why this Project?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the numerical and graphical examination of data characteristics and relationships before formal, rigorous statistical analyses are applied.

EDA can lead to insights, which may uncover other questions, and eventually predictive models. It also is an important “line of defense” against bad data and is an opportunity to notice that your assumptions or intuitions about a data set are violated.
